Title: HTML_Form_Project

Description: It is a Project that is done in both HTML and JavaScript. It is a Form where the entered details are stored in the "JsonPowerDB" Database. A peculiar feature about this project is the buttons used in the form. The form has 3 buttons namely 'save' , 'change' and 'reset' and is disabled by default. When a new record is being added, the 'save' and 'reset' button will be enabled and if a record is already present (based on 'full-name'), the 'change' and 'reset' button will be enabled.

Benefits of using JsonPowerDB: 
Completion Time: 2 days
[Note: the 'change' button is faulty and will be changed in the future]
